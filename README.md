Nov 9 - Working on a social media app
Nov 13 - Working on updating my macbook to download X code 9. Then saw tutorials to create ARkit app
Nov 16 - Created a mock app of AR ghosty! + Created an Icon
Nov 28 - Decided to erase the app of AR ghosty and create a new solo mission game app. In the beginning, I actually wanted to continue creating the AR app, but once I finished doing it, I faced difficulty. I wanted to develop my AR app so that a 3d character appears. However, to do so it not only required skills in coding, but also in photoshop. Due to time constraint, I decided to come up with a new project that was more interesting. Because it was way too simple to just keep the current AR app that I had since it didn't do much. When I actually showed my AR app to my peers, they said that it was "cool" but they all asked "so what does it do?" My previous AR app did not interact with the user much. So I decided to create a game that directly involved the users into the app.

Nice app! You put in a lot of work on the coding part. I hope that there's a point system and a "gameover" part. You said that you are working on the enemy part, so that's great! Also maybe there could be a little instruction for the users. That way when they open the app they will know how to play it right away.

I really like it. I can see how much work you have put in. The sound was especially intriguing because I felt really exciting whenever I heard the sound of me killing the enemies. （I showed kyra the app and asked her to evaluate it and I wrote it down according to what she said )

I actually want to download. I can't wait to actually see it in the app store! I hope this would be real, because this is a really interesting, fun, and addicting game. I showed Anne the app and asked her to evaluate it and I wrote it down according to what she said )
